  - People:
    - have people create desire paths
      - initial branching is good, but people settle on the most efficient path
        too quickly
      - crypto stepping penalty is too high
      - when penalty is low, they create the most direct path, when it is
        high, they always follow existing paths no matter the inconvenience
      - need randomness?
    - could have different personalities by pre-computing per boulder for each profile
      - always takes shortest distance <-- will just create the correct paths
      - always takes existing path  <-- will just never destroy anything
      - creates shortcuts at some sort of threshold <-- THIS is the one I need to make first
    - clean up people who have reached destination
      - or have them return?
      - or have them pick a different boulder
    - can it looks like footprints?

  - Crypto:
    - early growth looks white
      - need to blend with the tan (255, 235, 205)
    - tune growth rate
      - start with a greater concentration
      - even slower growth
      - never fully fill up the screen
        - growth asymptotic with health?
      - some sort of runaway failure?
      - paths fill in too quickly
    - calculate overall "health"

  - Game:
    - differentiate desire paths from paths you've created?
    - lose game at certain level of health
    - track total people spawned
    - add plot of crypto health over time?
    - trail creation:
      - indicate that lack of money is preventing trail creation
      - end click state when money is out to prevent spotting
    - better UI placement for money, etc.
