  - A*
    - needs to run in a worker
      - move everything into their own modules
      - get worker up and running
      - should crypto be simulated in the worker too?
    - alternatively, A* across a smaller grid that averages/sums each quadrant

  - People:
    - spawn them (along edges?)
    - destination towards a boulder
    - destroy crypto under foot -- can it look like foot prints?


  - Crypto:
    - tune growth rate
    - calculate over all "health"

  - Game:
    - mouse to erase crypto
    - spend money on mouse use
    - lose game at certain level of health
    - add plot of crypto health over time?
